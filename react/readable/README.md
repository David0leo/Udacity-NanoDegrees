This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run this application you must first install all dependencies.

Download or clone this repository (or just this project) and navigate to the /readable/ directory. With node installed in the command line, run the following command:

$ npm install

Start up the backend development server with the following commands from the /readable/ directory:

$ cd backend
$ npm install
$ node server

With the backend development server started, you can start up the application:

(if you are still in the /backend/ directory)
$ cd ..
(otherwise start here from the /readable/ directory)
$ npm start

This will serve up the application at localhost:3000.
