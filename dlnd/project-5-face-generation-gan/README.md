# Project 5 - Face Generation GAN
Project 5 involved building a GAN similar to the DCGAN architechture. The GAN used data from the CelebA dataset of celebrity faces to generate new faces. For testing, the MNIST hand-written letters dataset was also used. The network was able to generate new numbers and faces with a moderate level of success. As is usual with GANs, there was some level of distortion to many of the generated images.

## Some Details
The [notebook](https://github.com/David0leo/Udacity-NanoDegrees/blob/master/dlnd/project-5-face-generation-gan/dlnd_face_generation.ipynb) file contains implementation details. 

The network architechture is pretty much the [DCGAN](https://github.com/Newmu/dcgan_code) architecture.
