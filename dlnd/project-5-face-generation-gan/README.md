# Project 5 - Face Generation GAN
Project 5 involved building a GAN similar to the DCGAN architechture. The GAN used data from the CelebA dataset of celebrity faces to generate new faces. For testing, the MNIST hand-written letters dataset was also used. The network was able to generate new numbers and faces with a moderate level of success. As is usual with GANs, there was some level of distortion to many of the generated images.

## Some Details
The [notebook](https://github.com/David0leo/Udacity-NanoDegrees/blob/master/dlnd/project-5-face-generation-gan/dlnd_face_generation.ipynb) file contains implementation details. 

The network architechture is pretty much the [DCGAN](https://github.com/Newmu/dcgan_code) architecture. 

### Generator
The GAN uses a generator network similar in structure to the one below:
![Architecture](https://github.com/David0leo/Udacity-NanoDegrees/blob/master/dlnd/project-5-face-generation-gan/dcgan.png?raw=true)

The generator takes in a randomized noise vector z, and generates new images through processing throughout some transposed convolution layers.

### Discriminator
New images generated by the Generator are mixed in with real images from the dataset being used. The Discriminator then acts as a classifier. It's architecture looks similar to the generator architecture but reversed. At the end, the Discriminator outputs whether a given image is fake or real.

### Training
Both parts of the GAN are working against each other. The Generator is trying to fool the Discriminator, and the Discriminator is working to improve it's predictions.

#### MNIST Dataset
After training on the MNIST dataset, my network produces some interesting images:

Some samples from the GAN. These are taken at increasing number of training iterations.
