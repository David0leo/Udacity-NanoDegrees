# Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree
Here I have all the project files from my Udacity DLND.

## Project 1 - Your First Neural Network
Project 1 covered building and training a Neural Network using just Python, numpy, and pandas.
The built network was trained to predict daily bike rental ridership based on data from the UCI Machine Learning Database.

## Project 2 - Image Classification
Project 2 covered building a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification.
The network was trained on a sample of images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. 

## Project 3 - Generate TV Scripts
Project 3 covered building a recurrent neural network to generate new tv scripts.
The RNN was trained on parts of a Kaggle dataset containing 27 seasons of scripts from The Simpsons. The parts of the dataset where those contianing scenes from Moe's Tavern. 
The network was not very successful at creating coherent dialogue. However, it did show a decent ability to construct sentences with a semblence of proper grammar and general structure. 

## Project 4 - English to French Translation
Project 4 involved building and training a sequence to sequence model on English and corresponding French sentences. 
The network was fairly sucessful at translating sentences containing the 227 words used during training. Sentences with words outside of that range showed worse results, but that is to be expected. Training on a larger corpus with the same network could produce some promising results.
